# pixel-text
## first idea (idiot proof)
I was shitting one day and I thought "Hey, since there are 255 ascii characters with each associated with a value, and one rgb pixel contains 3 255 values for the three color mixtures, can't I technically convert a text file into a image file with a 3 to 1 letter to pixel ratio for maximum confusion for my fellow friends?". So uh, I did. 
## second idea (idoit proof)
I shat one day and I thought "Hey, can't I do an even more confusing encryption technique by instead combining each 8 bit binary digit to each other by adding 8 bit values to the left ( so 10010101 and 11111101 would be 1001010111111101 ) and then convert the final result into decimal system and technically, a whole file can be a string of numbers". So uh, I still nave confusion on doing this.
