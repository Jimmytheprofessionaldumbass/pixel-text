# pixel-text
first idea (idiot proof)
I was shitting one day and I thought "Hey, since there are 255 ascii characters with each associated with a value, and one rgb pixel contains 3 255 values for the three color mixtures, can't I technically convert a text file into a image file with a 3 to 1 letter to pixel ratio for maximum confusion for my fellow friends?". So uh, I did.
